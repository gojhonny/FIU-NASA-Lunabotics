===================

NASA's Lunabotics Mining Competition is a university-level competition designed to engage and retain students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The FIU Lunabotics team designed and built an excavator, called a Lunabot, that had the ability to mine and deposit a minimum of 10 kilograms of lunar simulant within 10 minutes.
