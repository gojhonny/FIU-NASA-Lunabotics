2012 FIU NASA Lunabotics
===================

NASA's Lunabotics Mining Competition is a university-level competition designed to engage and retain students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The FIU Lunabotics team designed and built an excavator, called a Lunabot, that had the ability to mine and deposit a minimum of 10 kilograms of lunar simulant within 10 minutes.

Using this code
--
Feel free to use any or all the code! This code was created for the Arduino, specifically the Uno with a WiFly shield. The code within this repo does many things, but one of the most important is transmitting commands to the robot thru wifi (telnet). 

Many things could have been improved on or implemented differently but couldn't do to the short window span. You can do better!
